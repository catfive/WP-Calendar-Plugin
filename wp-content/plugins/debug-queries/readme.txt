List query-actions only for admins; for debug purposes

== Description ==
List query-actions only for admins; for debug purposes. See all queries on the frontend of the blog and find the slowest part.

Since version 1.0.0 the plugin disable the MySQL query cache for the current connected session. That will show you the real execution time for a query. To disable this behavior set the constant `QUERY_CACHE_TYPE_OFF` to `FALSE`.


The plugin is perfect for WordPress developers, plugin and theme developers and site administrators who are trying to find out why the blog is too slow.
